I updated my springloaded jar to version 1.2.4.BUILD-SNAPSHOT (from 1.2.1) and that resolved the issue. (Latest version can be found in the Spring repo)

    Go to your local Grails lib directory to find springloaded jar. For me that was /usr/local/Cellar/grails/2.4.4/libexec/lib/org.springframework/springloaded/jars/
    remove existing 1.2.1 jars (I removed pom file, too, but not necessary)
    download latest springloaded jar and place into the jars subdir: wget http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot-local/org/springframework/springloaded/1.2.4.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/springloaded-1.2.4.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
